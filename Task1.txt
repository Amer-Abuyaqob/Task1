Q1) Explain the purpose of the following Git commands:

a. git status:
Shows the current state of your working directory and staging area-- This shows:-
	* Untracked files (new files)
	* Modified files
	* Files already staged for commit.

b. git init:
Creates a new local Git repository in the current directory (folder) to start tracking changes.

c. git commit:
Saves (records) the staged changes into the local repository with a message describing what was changed.

d. git push:
Uploads the committed changes from rthe local repository to a remote repository.

Q2) 

I disagree with Ahmed's statement

New (untracked) files are not automatically included in commits unless explicitly added with [git add].

The [git add] command stages changes, and allows to selectively choose which modifications to include in a commit.

Without staging we risk committing unintended changes.
